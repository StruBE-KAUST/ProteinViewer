Example for RANCH run

Goal: build single protein chain consisting of
* rigid domain for FKBP
* flexible linker with TG - (10 x GS) - TG
* rigid domain for mCitrine

Starting files:

- input_fk_Cit.pdb: contains both domains but no linker structure

- domain01_fk.pdb : extracted from input, only FKBP domain

- domain02_cit.pdb: extracted from input, only mCitrine domain
- domain02_cit_clean.pdb: same but CRO chromophore residue deleted
NOTE:
        both citrine structures contain three N-terminal residues that are not
        supposed to be in the target model (DPM)

- target.fasta: the actual target molecule
BUT:
        - contains "X" where the CRO residue would be
        - does not contain the non-native N-term residues in the Citrine PDB
- target_clean.fasta:
        - X removed
        - non-native DPM residues added to N-term of Citrine sequence

Run RANCH:
    sequence: target_clean.fasta
    domains: 2
    domain 1: domain01_fk.pdb
    domain 2: domain02_cit_clean.pdb
